  "title": "Design and Analysis of Algorithms",
  "description": "This course is an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. It covers a variety of classical algorithms and data structures and their complexity analysis. Topics include: divide-and-conquer algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and NP-completeness. The course will also cover some advanced topics such as randomized algorithms and approximation algorithms.
